## About
JPT is a Java-based project that leverages pre-trained transformer models for natural language processing tasks. The goal is to provide a robust and scalable solution for integrating transformer models in Java applications.

## Features
- Integration with GPT models
- Easy setup and configuration
- Pre-configured environment for development
- Supports custom configuration files

## Technologies Used
- **Java:** The primary programming language used for developing the API.
- **Gradle:** Used for building and managing project dependencies.
- **MySQL:** Database server for storing application data.
- **Pre-trained Transformer Models:** Leveraging models like GPT for NLP tasks.

## Installation
